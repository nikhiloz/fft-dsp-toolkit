Open-Source DSP Tutorial — Written Entirely in C, Zero Dependencies

I've been building a hands-on tutorial repository that teaches Digital Signal Processing from the ground up — using nothing but C99 and libm.

Repository: https://github.com/nikhiloz/dsp-tutorial-suite

What's inside:
• 9 progressive tutorial chapters — from complex number arithmetic to Cooley-Tukey FFT, window functions, FIR filter design, and spectral analysis
• Every chapter has a self-contained .c demo you can compile and run immediately
• 10 PlantUML architecture diagrams embedded in the docs
• 12 unit tests, all passing under -Wall -Wextra -Werror
• GNU Make + CMake build — clone, make, done. No Python, no pip, no package managers

The code is written to be read. Comments cross-reference the tutorial text and diagrams, so you can study the math, look at the butterfly diagram, then open fft.c and see exactly how it maps to code.

Who is this for?
• Embedded / systems engineers who work in C and want to understand DSP without wading through MATLAB or Python wrappers
• CS / EE students looking for a practical, code-first introduction to FFT and filtering
• Anyone curious about how audio processing, spectrum analysers, or software-defined radio actually work under the hood

Contributing:
The repo is open for contributions and experimentation. Chapters 06 (Real-Time Streaming) and 07 (Optimisation — SIMD, cache layout) are outlined but not yet implemented. If you want to add a new window function, try a different FFT radix, implement overlap-add streaming, or port it to an embedded target — fork it, experiment, and open a PR.

Even if you just find a clearer way to explain something in the tutorials, that counts.
